# :computer: My Portfolio

> :warning: The site is not ready

I created this site while I was taking front-end classes. As I said before the site is not ready. 

To be honest most of the content there 

The following sections are about the portfolio content:

## Technologies I've used in the past

I considered "the technologies that I've used" to be all the things that I had some kind of experience in the past

- __R:__ Took some classes that used R, mostly for data visualization;
- __Python:__ Currently using python on a project;
- __SQL:__ Studying databases with SQL;
- __Java:__ Some classes that I took in college used Java;
- __HTML & CSS:__ As I said before I created this portfolio to train my "front-end habilities";
- __JavaScrip:__ That's something that I'm at the early levels of knowlegde haha
